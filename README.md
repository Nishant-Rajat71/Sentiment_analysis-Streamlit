# 🧠 Social Media Sentiment Analyzer

This is a web app that:
- Extracts text from social media images using OCR (Tesseract)
- Classifies the sentiment using a pre-trained Naive Bayes model

## 📁 How it Works
1. Upload an image containing text (e.g., tweets, comments)
2. The app extracts text using pytesseract
3. The model predicts if the sentiment is **Positive** or **Negative**
